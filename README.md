# Cross Reference for Google Docs

Cross Reference is a free add-on for Google Docs that allows users to label elements such as tables and figures, and then updates in-text references to those elements with the right number, text and formatting. Users can customise the text and the style of the text for labels and references.

*Version 2 of Cross Reference will allow users to create their own label/reference pairings, which they can use to reference equations, sections, chapters and so on.*

## Installation

Cross Reference is available free of charge in the Google Add-ons store, which can be accessed from within an open Google Document. From the *Add-ons* menu, go to *Get add-ons...* and search for 'Cross Reference'. Click on the blue *Free* button in the Cross Reference panel. Once installed, Cross Reference will appear under the *Add-ons* menu.
